            <p>
                My name is Gus and I am a Computer Science and Robotics student at Worcester
                Polytechnic Institute.
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up in Acton, Massachusetts and have lived in Mass my whole life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though my career passion is coding, my favorite activities are hiking, playing soccer,
                and biking.
